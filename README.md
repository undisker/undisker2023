# Undisker 2023 (Ethernal Beta) - Free Edition

I finally decided to **stop supporting Undisker after 1. January 2023**.

Undisker was started on *December 1995* and now finished on *December 2022*. It was a good time last 27 years, but now it's just time to stop. Looks like the time of physical media is over in favor of cloud solutions, which are much easy to be controlled externally.  

The very last version of Undisker is called 2023 and it's free for any kind of usage under Mozilla Public License 2.0. You can do whatever you want with that.

I want to thank all Undisker users and developers ever participated in this project.

Yours,
Oleg Akopov
