# Undisker 2023 (Eternal Beta) - Free Edition

I finally decided to stop supporting Undisker after 1. January 2023.
Looks like the time of physical media is over in favor of much easily controllable cloud solutions.Undisker was started on December 1995 and now finished on December 2022.


It was a good time last 27 years, but now it's just time to stop. I want to thank all Undisker users and developers ever participated in this project.

Yours,

Oleg Akopov
