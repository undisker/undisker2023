## History of Undisker

It's hard to believe, but Undisker was introduced back in 1995 and distributed over FidoNet and regional BBSs with unforgettable sounds of my modem on 14,400 bps. This version was just a small DOS application, designed mostly for extracting files from OS/2 Fixpacks, which were distributed those times as bunch of floppy disk images.

The very first version was called  "DSKman", named by the extension of OS/2 fixpack image files  "\*.DSK". At the beginning it supported only FAT-12 floppy images, and only IBM XDF DSK-1 format (OS/2 Warp 3.0). After positive feedback in Fido, I was asked for new features (support for DiskDupe DDI and other image formats, a "Norton Commander "-like UI, etc). 

I had some time during Christmas holidays, so version 2.0 alfa was released just one month later, in December 1995. I added some Easter eggs for New Year 1996, and named this application  "Undisker", to underline that source physical disks are no longer required for extracting files. That's how the Undisker was born. 

During next years, a lot of different versions were released, but unfortunately all of them are gone, when my CD backups from later 1990s got damaged during transportation.  

In 2001 by request of a QSX shareware group I re-implemented Undisker as a Windows application, this time with support for CD and DVD images, keeping in mind my personal unlucky experience with old CD backups. Windows version of Undisker was compatible with all OS versions, starting from Win95 OSR2.    

Problems started later in 2007, when Windows Vista was released, causing additional headache with hardware support and UAC. Undisker was not updated for years, still counting on older Windows versions. 

At the end, I decided to recall Copyright back and registered Undisker as a trademark, in order to save my former pet project. Results still can be used, and now for free.
